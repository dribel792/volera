# Anduin — Instant Settlement Infrastructure

**On-chain settlement infrastructure for crypto trading platforms.**

Anduin enables instant, verifiable settlement for derivatives and tokenized securities. When a trade closes, PnL settles to the trader's wallet in seconds. When a trader wants their position as a token, it's delivered atomically against payment.

---

## The Problem

When a trader closes a position on a crypto platform, the profit or loss is "realized" — but the actual money movement is anything but instant:

- **Delays:** Profits can take hours to days to reach a trader's wallet
- **Counterparty risk:** Funds sit in broker-controlled omnibus accounts
- **No transparency:** Traders can't verify their PnL was processed correctly
- **No portability:** Positions are stuck on the platform — no way to take them on-chain

This is the plumbing problem of crypto trading. Everyone builds the shiny front-end. Nobody fixes the pipes.

---

## What Anduin Does

### Pillar 1: Issuance (Phase 2)
Regulated issuance of tokenized securities, structured products, and derivatives:
- **Delta-one trackers:** Equities, indices, commodities, precious metals
- **Yield products:** Covered calls, auto-callables, buffered notes
- **Securitized perps:** Mirror notes with explicit leverage and funding pass-through
- **On-demand tokenization:** Non-tokenized by default, tokenized when user withdraws to wallet

### Pillar 2: Instant Settlement (MVP — This Repo)
On-chain PnL settlement in seconds:
- **Win:** USDC credited to trader's on-chain PnL balance (withdrawable immediately)
- **Loss:** Collateral seized and returned to broker pool
- **DVP:** Security tokens delivered atomically against payment

### Pillar 3: Prime / Cross-Venue Netting (Phase 2)
One deposit → credit usable across multiple venues:
- Pre-trade margin checks
- Cross-venue position netting (60%+ margin savings)
- Hourly/daily settlement with default waterfall
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/PRIME_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

---

## Upcoming Features (Phase 2)

### 🔒 Private Settlements
Hide settlement amounts from public blockchain view while maintaining verifiability:
- Commitment-based settlement (amounts hidden)
- Encrypted memos for user verification
- Regulator-auditable
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/PRIVATE_SETTLEMENTS.md)**

### ⚡ Batch Settlements
Net multiple trades into single on-chain transaction for HFT traders:
- 5-minute settlement windows
- Off-chain netting with Merkle proofs
- 88-96% gas savings
- Claim-based settlement (lazy execution)
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/BATCH_SETTLEMENTS.md)**

### 💎 Multi-Collateral Support
Accept ETH, WBTC, and other tokens as collateral:
- Oracle-based margin calculation
- LTV ratios per token (ETH 80%, WBTC 75%)
- Automated liquidations
- Margin calls when ratio < 120%
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/MULTI_COLLATERAL.md)**

## How Instant Settlement Works

```
Trader Wallet ←→ UnifiedAccountVault (Base L2)
                         ↑
                   Broker Bridge
                         ↑
                  Trading Platform
```

1. **Trader deposits collateral** (USDC) into an on-chain vault
2. **Trader trades** on a connected platform as normal
3. **Trade closes** — broker reports realized PnL
4. **Anduin settles instantly:**
   - **Profit →** USDC credited to trader's PnL balance
   - **Loss →** Collateral seized to broker pool
5. **Trader withdraws** whenever they want — no delays

### The Key Insight

Anduin splits user funds into two buckets:
- **Collateral** — at-risk capital that can be seized on losses
- **PnL** — winnings that are *never* seizable, only withdrawable

This separation means traders always keep their profits, and platforms always recover their losses. Enforced in the smart contract — no trust required.

## Security Token Delivery (DVP)

Beyond PnL settlement, Anduin handles atomic delivery of security tokens:

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **BUY** | User locks USDC → receives security token in wallet |
| **SELL** | User locks token → receives USDC |
| **TOKENIZE** | Off-chain position → token delivered to wallet (no payment) |
| **DETOKENIZE** | Token deposited → off-chain position restored |

This enables the "non-tokenized by default, tokenized on-demand" model: users trade normally on the platform, and only tokenize when they want to withdraw their position to DeFi.

## Safety Features

Anduin implements enterprise-grade safety mechanisms to protect against edge cases and attacks:

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Circuit Breaker** | ✅ | Auto-pause if settlement volume spikes (prevents runaway settlements) |
| **Underwater Accounts** | ✅ | Insurance fund + socialized loss tracking for insufficient collateral |
| **Oracle Failover** | ✅ | Graceful degradation to last-known-good price (max 5 min age) |
| **Timelock Controller** | ✅ | 24h delay on critical admin changes (prevents instant key compromise) |
| **Withdrawal Cooldown** | ✅ | Configurable delay prevents flash loan attacks (default: disabled) |
| **Missing Events** | ✅ | Complete event coverage for monitoring and compliance |
| **Multi-Collateral** | ⏸️ | Haircuts for ETH/WBTC collateral (design complete, deferred to post-MVP) |
| **Withdrawal Queue** | ⏸️ | Handle broker insolvency edge cases (design complete, deferred) |

**[Full Documentation](docs/edge-cases.md)**

### Production Deployment Checklist

Before going live:
- ✅ Configure circuit breaker threshold for expected volumes
- ✅ Set withdrawal cooldown (recommended: 1 block minimum)
- ✅ Fund insurance pool with appropriate reserves
- ✅ Deploy TimelockController and transfer admin
- ✅ Configure oracle failover max age (recommended: 5 min)
- ✅ Set up monitoring for CircuitBreakerTriggered and Shortfall events

---

## Insurance Fund

Anduin includes a built-in **insurance fund** to handle underwater accounts and prevent socialized losses.

### How It Works

When a trader loses more than their deposited collateral, the system follows this waterfall:

1. **User collateral** — Seize available collateral first
2. **Insurance fund** — Cover shortfall from insurance reserves
3. **Socialized losses** — Track remaining loss (requires admin intervention)

```
User collateral:     $1,000
Trading loss:        $5,000
Insurance fund:      $50,000

Result:
├─ Seized:           $1,000 (from user)
├─ Insurance used:   $4,000 (from fund)
└─ Broker pool:      +$5,000 (fully covered)
```

### Admin Functions

- `depositInsuranceFund(amount)` — Replenish reserves
- `withdrawInsuranceFund(amount)` — Extract reserves
- `seizeCollateralCapped(user, amount, refId)` — Auto-uses insurance if needed

**Events:**
- `Shortfall(user, amount, coveredByInsurance, socialized)` — When insurance is used
- `InsuranceFundDeposited(amount)` — When admin adds funds
- `InsuranceFundWithdrawn(amount)` — When admin withdraws

**Monitoring:**
- Track `insuranceFund` balance (recommend 5-10% of total collateral)
- Alert on `totalSocializedLosses > 0`
- Watch `Shortfall` events for underwater accounts

## Exchange Integrations

Anduin connects to **8 trading venues** via a modular adapter system:

| Venue | Type | Markets | Integration |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Bybit** | CEX | BTC/ETH perpetuals | WebSocket |
| **Kraken** | CEX | Spot + Futures | WebSocket |
| **OKX** | CEX | USDT/Coin perpetuals | WebSocket |
| **Bitget** | CEX | USDT futures | WebSocket |
| **MEXC** | CEX | Perpetuals | WebSocket |
| **KuCoin** | CEX | Futures | WebSocket (token) |
| **HTX** | CEX | Linear swaps | WebSocket (gzip) |
| **MetaTrader 5** | CFD | Forex, Gold, Indices | REST (EA bridge) |

### Architecture

```
Exchange WebSocket
        ↓
  VenueAdapter (normalize data)
        ↓
  PriceAggregator (best bid/ask across all venues)
        ↓
  SettlementBridge (map position close → on-chain action)
        ↓
  UnifiedAccountVault (creditPnl / seizeCollateral)
```

### Features

- **Real-time price aggregation** — Get best bid/ask across all venues
- **Position monitoring** — Automatically settle when positions close
- **Auto-reconnection** — Exponential backoff on WebSocket disconnects
- **Idempotent settlement** — `refId = keccak256(venue + positionId)` prevents duplicates
- **Easy onboarding** — Add new exchange in <100 lines of code

### Quick Example

```typescript
import { AdapterFactory, PriceAggregator, SettlementBridge } from '@anduin/integrations';

// Create adapters
const bybit = AdapterFactory.createAdapter('bybit');
const kraken = AdapterFactory.createAdapter('kraken');

// Set up price aggregation
const aggregator = new PriceAggregator();
aggregator.addAdapter(bybit);
aggregator.addAdapter(kraken);
await aggregator.connectAll(['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT']);

// Subscribe to best prices
aggregator.onAggregatedPrice((price) => {
  console.log(`${price.symbol} Best: ${price.bestBid}/${price.bestAsk}`);
});

// Handle position closes
const bridge = new SettlementBridge();
bybit.onPositionClose(async (position) => {
  const action = bridge.mapPositionToSettlement(position, userAddress, true);
  if (action.type === 'credit') {
    await vault.creditPnl(action.user, action.amount, action.refId);
  } else {
    await vault.seizeCollateralCapped(action.user, action.amount, action.refId);
  }
});
```

---

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Setup fee** | €250k per broker integration |
| **Platform fee** | €10-30k MRR |
| **Settlement fee** | 0.5-2.0 bps on notional |
| **Tokenization fee** | Per-token fee on DVP |

---

## Moat

1. **Audit-grade reconciliation** — Exactly-once settlement, breaks aging, replay tooling
2. **Safety infrastructure** — Caps, cooldowns, pause circuits, timelock governance
3. **Network effects** — Shared issuance tokens, multi-broker liquidity
4. **Liability transfer** — We take on operational risk and SLAs

A broker could fork the contracts. They can't fork:
- Months of ops tooling and incident response
- Compliance templates and audit history
- The network of other platforms sharing liquidity

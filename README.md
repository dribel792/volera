# Volera — Instant Settlement Infrastructure

**On-chain settlement infrastructure for crypto trading platforms.**

Volera enables instant, verifiable settlement for derivatives and tokenized securities. When a trade closes, PnL settles to the trader's wallet in seconds. When a trader wants their position as a token, it's delivered atomically against payment.

## The Problem

When a trader closes a position on a crypto platform, the profit or loss is "realized" — but the actual money movement is anything but instant:

- **Delays:** Profits can take hours to days to reach a trader's wallet
- **Counterparty risk:** Funds sit in broker-controlled omnibus accounts
- **No transparency:** Traders can't verify their PnL was processed correctly
- **No portability:** Positions are stuck on the platform — no way to take them on-chain

This is the plumbing problem of crypto trading. Everyone builds the shiny front-end. Nobody fixes the pipes.

## What Volera Does

### Pillar 1: Issuance (Phase 2)
Regulated issuance of tokenized securities, structured products, and derivatives:
- **Delta-one trackers:** Equities, indices, commodities, precious metals
- **Yield products:** Covered calls, auto-callables, buffered notes
- **Securitized perps:** Mirror notes with explicit leverage and funding pass-through
- **On-demand tokenization:** Non-tokenized by default, tokenized when user withdraws to wallet

### Pillar 2: Instant Settlement (MVP — This Repo)
On-chain PnL settlement in seconds:
- **Win:** USDC credited to trader's on-chain PnL balance (withdrawable immediately)
- **Loss:** Collateral seized and returned to broker pool
- **DVP:** Security tokens delivered atomically against payment

### Pillar 3: Prime / Cross-Venue Netting (Phase 2)
One deposit → credit usable across multiple venues:
- Pre-trade margin checks
- Cross-venue position netting (60%+ margin savings)
- Hourly/daily settlement with default waterfall
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/PRIME_ARCHITECTURE.md)**

## Upcoming Features (Phase 2)

### 🔒 Private Settlements
Hide settlement amounts from public blockchain view while maintaining verifiability:
- Commitment-based settlement (amounts hidden)
- Encrypted memos for user verification
- Regulator-auditable
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/PRIVATE_SETTLEMENTS.md)**

### ⚡ Batch Settlements
Net multiple trades into single on-chain transaction for HFT traders:
- 5-minute settlement windows
- Off-chain netting with Merkle proofs
- 88-96% gas savings
- Claim-based settlement (lazy execution)
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/BATCH_SETTLEMENTS.md)**

### 💎 Multi-Collateral Support
Accept ETH, WBTC, and other tokens as collateral:
- Oracle-based margin calculation
- LTV ratios per token (ETH 80%, WBTC 75%)
- Automated liquidations
- Margin calls when ratio < 120%
- **[Architecture Doc](docs/MULTI_COLLATERAL.md)**

## How Instant Settlement Works

```
Trader Wallet ←→ UnifiedAccountVault (Base L2)
                         ↑
                   Broker Bridge
                         ↑
                  Trading Platform
```

1. **Trader deposits collateral** (USDC) into an on-chain vault
2. **Trader trades** on a connected platform as normal
3. **Trade closes** — broker reports realized PnL
4. **Volera settles instantly:**
   - **Profit →** USDC credited to trader's PnL balance
   - **Loss →** Collateral seized to broker pool
5. **Trader withdraws** whenever they want — no delays

### The Key Insight

Volera splits user funds into two buckets:
- **Collateral** — at-risk capital that can be seized on losses
- **PnL** — winnings that are *never* seizable, only withdrawable

This separation means traders always keep their profits, and platforms always recover their losses. Enforced in the smart contract — no trust required.

## Security Token Delivery (DVP)

Beyond PnL settlement, Volera handles atomic delivery of security tokens:

| Flow | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **BUY** | User locks USDC → receives security token in wallet |
| **SELL** | User locks token → receives USDC |
| **TOKENIZE** | Off-chain position → token delivered to wallet (no payment) |
| **DETOKENIZE** | Token deposited → off-chain position restored |

This enables the "non-tokenized by default, tokenized on-demand" model: users trade normally on the platform, and only tokenize when they want to withdraw their position to DeFi.

## Why Base L2

- **Low fees:** Settlements cost fractions of a cent
- **Fast finality:** Transactions confirm in seconds
- **USDC native:** Circle's USDC is natively issued on Base
- **EVM compatible:** Standard tooling, easy integration

## Current Status

**MVP** — Full stack built, pending testnet deployment.

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| UnifiedAccountVault | ✅ 57 tests passing |
| SecurityTokenVault | ✅ Contract written |
| TradingHoursGuard | ✅ Contract written |
| OracleGuard | ✅ Contract written |
| Backend services | ✅ Built |
| Frontend dashboard | ✅ Built |
| Base Sepolia deployment | ⏳ Pending |
| Security audit | ⏳ Planned (€17k budget) |

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Setup fee** | €250k per broker integration |
| **Platform fee** | €10-30k MRR |
| **Settlement fee** | 0.5-2.0 bps on notional |
| **Tokenization fee** | Per-token fee on DVP |

## Moat

1. **Audit-grade reconciliation** — Exactly-once settlement, breaks aging, replay tooling
2. **Safety infrastructure** — Caps, cooldowns, pause circuits, timelock governance
3. **Network effects** — Shared issuance tokens, multi-broker liquidity
4. **Liability transfer** — We take on operational risk and SLAs

A broker could fork the contracts. They can't fork:
- Months of ops tooling and incident response
- Compliance templates and audit history
- The network of other platforms sharing liquidity

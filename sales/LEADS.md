## Outreach Templates

### Cold Email — CFD Broker
```
Subject: Instant crypto settlement for [BROKER] clients

[NAME],

Noticed [BROKER] is expanding crypto offerings. Quick question:

Are you running your own custody/settlement, or relying on a third party?

We built Volera — instant DVP (delivery vs payment) for tokenized securities on-chain. 
Think T+0 settlement, no counterparty risk, no custody overhead.

Already working with [social proof if any].

Worth 15 minutes to see if there's a fit?

### Cold Email — Crypto Exchange
```
Subject: Tokenized stocks for [EXCHANGE] users

[NAME],

Your users are asking for stock exposure. I've seen the feature requests.

Problem: Traditional securities = T+2 settlement, custody nightmares, regulatory hell.

Solution: Tokenized securities with instant on-chain DVP. Your users never leave your platform.

We're Volera — built specifically for this. Let me show you how [COMPETITOR] is doing it.

15 min call this week?
